# Plans:
## 1. Add a threat level system (0-100)
###     - Threat values system (300 blocks):
####        - the bum -- 15; the bum's teammate -- 15
####        - the server owner -- 25;
####        - anyone else on the server -- 10
####        - a wither -- 10
####        - a charged creeper -- 10
###     - Below 10 --> yellow title text: "low level threat nearby"
###     - 10~33 --> First trumpet/emergency 1
####        - First trumpet hud overlay
####        - All in game music stopped and replaced with first trumpet on loop
###     - 34~66 --> Second trumpet/emergency 2
####        - Second trumpet hud overlay
####        - All in game music stopped and replaced with second trumpet on loop
###     - 67~100 --> Third trumpet/emergency 3
####        - Third trumpet hud overlay
####        - All in game music stopped and replaced with third trumpet on loop
####        - If player below 50% hp, immediately leave server
####        - Enable pressing [end] to leave server
## 2. Add a radar system
###     - When the bum is within 400 blocks
####        - yellow title text: "==The bum is nearby=="
###     - When the bum is within 200 blocks
####        - red title text: "==!The bum is here!=="
###     - When an invisible entity (non-player) is within 400 blocks
####        - send chat message: "Alas for my blindness; there be a creature afar that I sense yet cannot see..."
###     - When an invisible entity (non-player) is within 200 blocks
####        - send chat message: "Yet what I cannot see, is already at the very gates."
###     - When an invisible player is within 400 blocks
####        - send chat message: "You are there, and I know it."
###     - When an invisible player is within 200 blocks
####        - send chat message: "Reveal thyself."
